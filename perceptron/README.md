# What is a Perceptron?
A Perceptron is the simplest form of a artificial neural network. It essentially can be thought of a linear binary classifier. This means it can only classify a number of inputs only into two parts(0 or 1).
# Components
A Perceptron is composed of a few key components they are the following:
* Input data
* Weights
* Activation Function
* Bias
* Learning algorithm
## Input Data
The input data of a Perceptron may be represented as a vector.
## Weights
Weights are values that assign a particular significance to a input. Regardless of the input value the weight either increases or decreases it.
## Bias
A bias is a value threshold for a sum of weighted inputs to be significant enough to be considered active.
## Activation Function
A function which takes input data, Weights and bias and computes an output which is mapped to two values 0 or 1. Other activation functions may represent an output as a range of values maybe between 0-1.
## Learning algorithm
The learning algorithm allows for the dynamic adjustment of weights and bias values based on predefined set of inputs and related outputs expected.

# Banana Identifier
Provided with this Perceptron example an application found in the tests directory shows how to use a Perceptron to Identify a banana on two input properties (weight and length).
